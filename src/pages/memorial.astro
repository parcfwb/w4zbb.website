                    A lifelong educator, Paul continued a family legacy established generations before him, and inspired
                    many others to join the profession. Paul enjoyed a 30-year teaching career at Aiken High School and
                    Cincinnati Technical College. He was also a veteran of the U.S. Navy, having served during the Cuban
                    Missile Crisis.</p>
                <p>
                    After retirement, and moving to Fort Walton Beach, Paul worked 11 years for the Supervisor of

                    community service also included Okaloosa Island Fire Commissioner, CERT, Leaseholders Association,
                    and Playground Amateur Radio Club. Paul was an avid supporter of the Eastern Panhandle Regional
                    Science Fair, judging and mentoring students and representing the Playground Amateur Radio Club in
                    providing awards to students whose projects related to Amateur Radio. This was one of Paul's
                    favorite involvements as it was a combination of his teaching profession and his hobby. It afforded
                    him the opportunity to continue his mission to help students and to promote his hobby of amateur
                    radio.

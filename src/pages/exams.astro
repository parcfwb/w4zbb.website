                Amateur Radio Operator Examinations are held at 0900 on the second Saturday of every odd month, with the
                exception of March, where the exams are held in conjunction with the PARC Swapfest. This date varies
                from year to year, so please contact the exam coordinator at the email address below for location and
                scheduling.
            </p>

            <p>
                With the exception of March, testing is held at the Playground Amateur Radio Club's clubhouse located at
                the intersection of 1st and Church Streets in downtown Fort Walton Beach. All candidates must bring a
                photo ID and existing licensees need an original copy of their FCC-issued license. The test fee is $15,
                payable by cash or check.
